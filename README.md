## Title
Foundit

## Description
Reddit analytics tool. Users will be able to see topline stats on Reddit threads and users. Stats
may include, users with the highest number of karma points, most popular subreddits and subreddit popularity trends, and most popular memes. Stats will be displayed on a custom website using data visualization.

## Vision Statement
To identify what is popular on Reddit. 

## Motivation
We love data and are regular reddit users. This tool will help us learn what is popular on Reddit, who is popular on Reddit,
which memes are popular, etc. We and users of our tool will learn 

## Risks
Data contents and format are unknown
Do not know how we will pull the data
Some team members will be working with new languages
No one on team knows HTML
Team members are working on other projects which might lead to issues with workload

## Mitigation Strategy
If the data appears unusable, we will switch data sets.
If we cannot extract the data, we will use another data set.
Members who are comfortable with a specific language will lead on areas using that language. 
If it is too difficult to build a website from scratch, we made use a web development GUI
If a team members workload becomes too much, others on the team will need to pick up the slack or we will scale back the scope.
