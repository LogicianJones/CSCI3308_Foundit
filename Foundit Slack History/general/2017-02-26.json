So as not to hold you and the scheduling of 'Part 2' up, I switched admin of Trello to Eugene and Luke (you can make others admins), Ken is owner of the Slack channel, and I initiated a transfer of the GitHub repository to Ryan (Ryan, you need to accept. Please be sure the link in the README reflects any changes in the repo URL although there should not be any changes.) Best of luck with the project. Kind Regards, Kristin",
